title: How to study change ?
layout: post
---

The last 10 years has been a step learning curve with all sorts of experience. Data, visualisation, academia, business, Chinese language, China, getting back to Europe, etc, all these experiments have left me with a dizzy feeling. What was the common point between all these? How can I define a research scope that will be useful for understanding ?

Getting from media studies to geography to management to computer science to anthropology, the question was identical : what is the common point of interest that will be insightful ? What is worth researching ?

Scientists are passionate about the questions of definitions. What is it? Ontological concerns have been at the foreground and the background of most major discovery for a least a century, and occupy the mind of scientists.

One of the major learning from spending years in China has been the following : 1) most of the time, things are often not what they appear to be - and 2) everything change all the time. The illusion of permanence is often related to an ignorance for process like decay - while improvements is mostly considered as 'the same, but better'.

During the last few years, I have been trying to understand extensively moving objects. In 2012, I started a phD research about memes on social media, then went on with observing urban transformations in China. At the center of these experiments was a methodological question : how to record and observe changes?

The most authroritarive argument in a discovery is 'this is that'. In social sciences, we forge concepts that usually needs to be verified on the "field", while harder sciences talk about theory and experiments. Studyong societies, how can we approach the question of changes? How useful is an ontological statement if we can not undesrtand its origins or becoming? It seeems to me that we live in a deeply "ontological" era, where things have to be defined. The mean for that is obviously writing, and more precisely its later flavor 'data'.

I am a big fan and practicioner of data analysis, but my experience so far is made mostly of frustration. Not because we don't have enough data (we have too much writing about most things already), but because those writing always manage to capture only an ephemeral state but is not usually interested in changes, transitions, transformations, etc. Usually, we record successive states of something, thinking that the difference between t=0 and t=1 will account for the transition.

Not that I have a better solution at hand, but it looks to me that the multiplication of successive definitions does not amount to what change really is. Maybe I have spent too much time in Asia where [books about changes](??) have been the norm for centuries.

I would like to propose what seems to me like a very challenging question, and therefore a vast research program that I am definitely not qualified to fullfil. Nevertheless, it seems to me that **studying change** looks like a very promising and interesting idea. More than trying an actual definition of this or that - at least on my side. To get started with that, there is a many questions that needs to answer. First, **how to record changes** ? Second (this is my aera of interest) : **how to visualize changes** ? More precisely, how to record, visualize and understand **changes in complex structures** ? For instance, it often occurs to me that networks are often considered as objects, when they mostly are a sum of trajectories and therefore should be understood as transforming elements.

*Visualizing changes** How many dimensions can an image have ?

The domain of questionning is so broad that the beginning of an answer should include theoretical reflections, empirical studies, fieldwork investigations, data and design experiments, etc. To get started with this gigantic program, I will like to layout some first ideas about how to approach this question. The post will start by a quick recollection of previous attempts/reflections from the previous years, and a tentative program for the next experiments (decades?) to come.


## Memes on Sina Weibo

My phD thesis was named 'XXX' and was mostly a methodological attempt to answer the question : *"Can we use social media data to study society ?"*, with the example of memes on Sina Weibo and mainland China. The answer was a sounding : *"No, please don't."*.

Of course, you can still use it to study media (as I do). Social media analytics is an absolutely fine way to study how media contribute to describe society and produce shared representations. Then, data does NOT XXX(dispense) you to go check by yourself what is really happening.

I built a data visualization engine to observe not only 'social' networks extracted from mentions/likes in conversations, but a geographical, lexical and relational picture of the meme to visualize the changes in these different networks over time.

## Historical cartography of university in Europe

This was a small attempt to visualize how universities spread around Europe. We worked on it with Eric Guichard at [AIL](http://barthes.enssib.fr/AIL), based on data compiled by Camille Ducrot. There is several major flaws in this map : the first one being borders... Obviously, looking at Europe with border data from the 16th century does not make any sense.
