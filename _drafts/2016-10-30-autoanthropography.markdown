title: Auto-anthropo-graphy

After a few days of formulating my will of writing, I still haven't written anything. More than that, I did not even press the "real" publish button, which will be to share the first post of this blog to the world. At least, I managed to push everything to a public repository which makes it available to the world. Chances that anyone will ever find it approximate zero though.

The real personal challenge still to find a clear context of finding a proper direction in writing (and life :D ). I have started with multiple topics than I am interested in : the transformation of perceptive space in Quattrecento and the visualization space, debt financing in the city of Shenzhen, hardware design and state security, etc. I have drafted each of this article but none seems really fit for publication, as they don't follow any editorial prospect or line.

So instead, I am going to write about my own research processes.

A friend told me yesterday that I should be more pedagogic about things I am doing, to explain and show it to people, instead of running in many directions. I will try to proceed to an [auto-ethnography]('http://www.recherche-qualitative.qc.ca/documents/files/revue/edition_reguliere/numero30(2)/RQ_30(2)_Rondeau.pdf')

of my work practices, as I am short of money to pay my analyst right now.
