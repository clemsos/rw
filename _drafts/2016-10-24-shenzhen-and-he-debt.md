Headlines have been copiously claiming that the city of Shenzhen was going to take over Silicon Valley. The next generation of successful products is going to revolve around robots, biotech and connected devices. Shenzhen is in many regards at the forefront of this trend. Its unique urban industrial infrastructure can support mass production of very complex products almost instantly, with virtually endless supply chain in all sort of scales.  Shenzhen has already become instrumental for any designer that looks at manufacturing, sanctified by Apple recent announcement to open a R&D center here [^1].

More than that, the whole city is in 30s ([34 y.o.](http://sz.house.qq.com/a/20150907/048637.htm) on average). Everyone is busy making it and the beat of the city is literally breathtaking if you are not used to. Elderly in visit usually found out that street level is unfit for them, as they don't even have time to cross half the road during usual red lights. This incredible velocity and the insane workaholic culture constitutes the key assets that may propel the city on the global stage.
